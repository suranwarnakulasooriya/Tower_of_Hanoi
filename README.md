# Tower of Hanoi
A Python program that solves the Tower of Hanoi problem for 3 to 12 disks and animates the solution.

## Dependencies
Assuming you have [Python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) already, pygame, colour, and tkinter should be the only dependencies not automatically installed. They can all be isntalled with `pip`.
```
pip install pygame
pip install colour
pip install tkinter
```
